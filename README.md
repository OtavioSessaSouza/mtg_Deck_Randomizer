at the moment the api only give a list of 100 cards that can be played with the commander(last in the list).

requirements:
    have node and npm.

To run the api:
    make sure to run the commands in the backend folder
    install the node modules running command: npm i
    to run use the command: npm run dev
    the api some times is slow, maybe take up to 3 minutes to get the cards back

Next:
make the api
    Get cards from a commander user give.
    Change the number of cards the api gets at random.
    make a Front end
